Every second when you breathe-in, millions of germs, viruses & bacteria enter into your body.

**What is a Immune System?**

We are always surrounded by bacteria, microbes, viruses, toxins, fungus, pollution and parasites to enter into our body every second when we breathe in. They are very powerful that they can even dismantle our entire body.

Look at a dead body - within a few weeks the entire body is decayed and destroyed.

Don't panic. We have a attentive doctor inside our body who works 24 x 7 daily - An amazing natural protection mechanism called the Immune system.

Have you ever seen your immune system working? You can notice it when it fails for some reason.

A cut in your body heals very quickly most of the times but sometimes it becomes a wound. Why? If your immune system works, it heals quickly; If it fails, then the bacteria have entered your body to cause damage.

When you breathe in, millions of germs, bacteria and viruses that are floating in the air go into your body. Your immune system defends your body against its attack. Occasionally a germ gets past the immune system and you catch a cold orflu -Avisible sign that your immune system failed to stop the germ.

The fine line between healthy and diseased body is crossed when the immune system fails or slows.

TODAY'S LIVING CONDITIONS HARM US MORE Stress, Pollution, Radiation, poisonous Insecticide & Pesticides, Chemical Fertilizers and Medicines, Smoking, Alcohol, Lack of exercise, bad eating habits, junk foods, synthetic preservatives, colors and additives -These actually harm our body more than ever before.

Some immune system disorders are evident immediately; others exist for years before any signs or damage occur.

Modern medicines advocate that most diseases are caused by "germs" and that, in order to get well, we must kill these germs. So, we take drugs, antibiotics, chemotherapy, radiation and even surgery but these not only kills the germs but also the good cells in our body.

When Our Cells Are Weak, Our Immune System Cannot Destroy The Bacteria, Viruses, Microbes, Toxins, & Parasites That Are All Around Us.

TO RE-ESTABLISH OUR HEALTH, WE NEED TO BALANCE OUR BODY BY WORKING WITH IT, NOT AGAINST IT

An effective Immune-System booster, multi-nutritional, natural supplement is the need of our daily requirement-much like brushing ourteeth everyday!!!

THAT IS ON & ON 9e5 PREMIUM HEALTH DRINK

**Why it is not recommended for children?**

The safety of sucralose is documented by one of the most extensive and thorough safety testing programs ever conducted on a new food additive. More than 100 studies conducted and evaluated over a 20-year period clearly demonstrate the safety of sucralose. Foods made with low-calorie sweeteners are not normally a recommended part of a child's diet, since calories are important to a growing child's body. Hence, considering the developmental requirements of growing Children and as recommended by the Food Safety & Standards Authority of India, we do not recommend 9E5 for Children.

**What are its benefits for our health?**

When association between changing lifestyle and increasing incidence of these disorders was studied in details the culprit was found be oxidative stress that is generated in the human body. Medicinal sciences have proved the role of oxidative stress in the development of lifestyle related disorders. Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of variety of disorders. Some important and common disorders that are related to oxidative stress are as follows: Heart diseases, Diabetes, Cancer, Arthritis, Alzheimer, Parkinson's disease, Digestive dysfunctions, AIDS etc. Oxidative stress is also associated with the process of aging. "Let food be your medicine and let medicine be your food" was advised by the father of medicine, Hippocrates, over two millennia ago. Herbal and natural products of folk medicine have been used for centuries in every culture throughout the world. Scientists and medical professionals have shown increased interest in this field as they recognize the true health benefits of these remedies. Plants have been used worldwide in traditional medicines for the treatment of diseases. It is estimated that even today approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of the world's population rely only on medicinal plants as their primary source of medicines. Antioxidants rich 9E5 is the substances that can take of the free radical and manage the oxidative stress. Antioxidants can be defined as substances whose presence in relatively low concentrations significantly inhibits the rate of oxidation of the targets. 9E5is not a medicine and can be effectively used in management of oxidative stress and for maintenance of the day to day activities. 9E5 contains a unique blend of Super Berry Fruits (Goji Berry, Strawberry, Blackberry, Raspberry, Blackcurrant, Blue Berry, Cherry, Cranberry, red Currant, Elderberry, Acai berry), Amla, Noni & Aloe Vera] that are known for their healthy properties, which are known for their health-promoting properties due to their high content of anthocyanins, flavonoids, polyphenols, polysaccharides etc.

**What are its side effect?**

If pregnant or lactating women, it is recommended to consult physician before taking this product. Less than 1% of population may be allergic to one or many ingredients present in 9E5. Some of the known experiences of such sensitivity are rash, itching, mild diarrhoea, or slight belching or trouble with breathing. Most of these symptoms are part of the body reaction to the sensitive ingredients or cleansing process of 9E5. It is recommended to skip a dose or two and consume lots of water. Most allergic symptoms disappear within 24 hours of discontinuing 9E5 and after the gap of 4 to 5 days, re enjoy the benefits of 9E5.

**Why the benefits are not printed in the package?**

9E5 is a food product and not a medicine. Having said that, antioxidants are helpful to manage oxidative stress and the benefits are broad spectrum and vary from person to person.

Caution is printed on the Carton.
