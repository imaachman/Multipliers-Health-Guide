# Product Details

**What are the benefits of the product?**

To reverse anaemia: a condition that makes a person ill, unable to do day to day course properly, lack of energy, breathlessness, pale skin, feeling tired, improper working of mind and brain: due to lack of or low level of haemoglobin in the body. Haemoglobin is an important component of blood especially related to the red blood corpuscles. Haemoglobin has an important element- iron- in its structure. There is a need for nutrient iron to be taken every day and this iron through food needs to be absorbed and converted to haemoglobin. If this does not happen then slowly the RBC count in the blood and haemoglobin level goes down. It is the haemoglobin that absorbs fresh oxygen from the lungs and gives away the carbon dioxide which is very important for normal functioning. Low levels of haemoglobin causes anaemia and its severe ill health conditions. Taking Fe'ALING syrup or capsule work to reverse the condition and make a person healthy and achieve required levels of haemoglobin in the body.
