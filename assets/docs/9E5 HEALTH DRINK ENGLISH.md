**What is a Immune System?**

We are always surrounded by bacteria, microbes, viruses, toxins, fungus, pollution and parasites to enter into our body every second when we breathe in. They are very powerful that they can even dismantle our entire body.

Look at a dead body - within a few weeks the entire body is decayed and destroyed.

Don't panic. We have a attentive doctor inside our body who works 24 x 7 daily - An amazing natural protection mechanism called the Immune system.

Have you ever seen your immune system working? You can notice it when it fails for some reason.

A cut in your body heals very quickly most of the times but sometimes it becomes a wound. Why? If your immune system works, it heals quickly; If it fails, then the bacteria have entered your body to cause damage.

When you breathe in, millions of germs, bacteria and viruses that are floating in the air go into your body. Your immune system defends your body against its attack. Occasionally a germ gets past the immune system and you catch a cold orflu -Avisible sign that your immune system failed to stop the germ.

The fine line between healthy and diseased body is crossed when the immune system fails or slows.

TODAY'S LIVING CONDITIONS HARM US MORE Stress, Pollution, Radiation, poisonous Insecticide & Pesticides, Chemical Fertilizers and Medicines, Smoking, Alcohol, Lack of exercise, bad eating habits, junk foods, synthetic preservatives, colors and additives -These actually harm our body more than ever before.

Some immune system disorders are evident immediately; others exist for years before any signs or damage occur.

Modern medicines advocate that most diseases are caused by "germs" and that, in order to get well, we must kill these germs. So, we take drugs, antibiotics, chemotherapy, radiation and even surgery but these not only kills the germs but also the good cells in our body.

When Our Cells Are Weak, Our Immune System Cannot Destroy The Bacteria, Viruses, Microbes, Toxins, & Parasites That Are All Around Us.

TO RE-ESTABLISH OUR HEALTH, WE NEED TO BALANCE OUR BODY BY WORKING WITH IT, NOT AGAINST IT

An effective Immune-System booster, multi-nutritional, natural supplement is the need of our daily requirement-much like brushing ourteeth everyday!!!
